# ConsoleGame_DwarfFortressLike

Unpack jsoncpp.zip to jsoncpp folder, in the same location where ReadMe is.
All controls shown when the game starts.
Weapon, Armor, Health potion and Magic mushroom (boosts weapon damage) are all types of class Item.
Saving configuration missing.
Suggestion: load cfg2.json (input 2 when prompted), because map is smaller than map from cfg1 and can whole be seen that way (when V is pressed).
Also, put command window in Fullscreen mode.
